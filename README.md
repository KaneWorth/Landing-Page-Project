# Landing-Page-Project
Final Odin Project CSS Foundations Challenge

This was the last project within the odin projects foundation css section.

The task was to create a web page from scratch, with no code provided, to look like an image they took of the final page.

We had no starting point and the task was to create this page and make it look like the image they shared.

At first, it was a struggle, but after a short time, I got into my stride and 5 hours later. I'd completed it.

I will say, doing this project made my confidence skyrocket when using the flexbox method.

So much so, I actually went on to re-design all of my personal projects outside of the course using the flex box method and made them look good.

The page is not responsive for smaller screens, but that is okay, the purpose was to simply make it look like the image they provided us with. Functionality and responsiveness was not part of the project. It is simply a template.

I've decided to upload this landing page because it makes a good project to display on my personal portfolio and the over all design of this page is actualyl reall nice and it has potential.
